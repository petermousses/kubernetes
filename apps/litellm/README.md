# LiteLLM deployment

deploy LiteLLM from the repository root with:

```sh
./apps/litellm/deploy.sh
```

run this script for every LiteLLM deployment instead of running
`kubectl apply -k apps/litellm` directly.

LiteLLM runs with automatic schema updates disabled. The script therefore
applies PostgreSQL and its network policies first, waits for PostgreSQL, stops
the gateway, recreates the version-pinned migration Job, and waits for the
migration to succeed before applying and restarting the gateway. A completed
Kubernetes Job does not rerun when its manifest is applied again, and
`kubectl apply` does not wait for that Job to complete before reconciling the
Deployment. Directly applying the kustomization can consequently start a new
LiteLLM version against an old database schema.

The script also prints retained migration logs and Job details on failure,
removes the obsolete Kubernetes Ingress left by the move to a Traefik
IngressRoute, waits for the new gateway Pod to become ready, and prints the
resulting resources.

Before the first deployment, create the uncommitted `litellm-env` Secret:

```sh
./apps/litellm/bootstrap-secrets.sh
```

The deploy script is intentionally idempotent. Rerunning the pinned migration
is safer than guessing whether a manifest edit requires it.
